GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output.
They are the pins on a microcontroller (like Arduino, ESP32, STM32, etc.) that can be programmed to either:
Read a signal (Input), or
Send a signal (Output)
In Simple Terms
GPIO pins are like tiny switches or communication points between the microcontroller and the outside world (sensors, LEDs, buzzers, buttons, etc.).


 Two Main Modes
Input Mode
Used to read signals (for example, checking if a button is pressed).
pinMode(pin, INPUT);
Example: Detect HIGH or LOW voltage from a sensor.

Output Mode
Used to send signals (for example, turning ON an LED or buzzer).
pinMode(pin, OUTPUT);
Example: Write HIGH to make LED glow, LOW to turn it off.

int ledPin = 13;  // GPIO pin connected to LED
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  // Set pin 13 as Output
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn LED ON
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // Turn LED OFF
  delay(1000);
}
Here, GPIO 13 is used to blink an LED.


In the direct connection example, what does lcd.print(millis() / 1000); display?
A. Number of loops executed
B. Number of milliseconds since reset
C. Number of seconds since reset
D. Sensor reading value
 Answer: C. Number of seconds since reset
