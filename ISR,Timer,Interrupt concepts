An ISR stands for Interrupt Service Routine.
In simple terms —
An ISR is a special function in your program that runs automatically when an interrupt occurs.
Detailed Explanation
When a specific event happens — like:
a button press,
a timer overflow,
or a sensor signal change,
the microcontroller pauses the main program and jumps immediately to execute the ISR function.

attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(2), toggle, FALLING);
void toggle() {
  digitalWrite(13, !digitalRead(13));
}
Here:
The event is the FALLING edge (button press: signal goes from HIGH → LOW).
The ISR is the function named toggle().
When the interrupt happens, toggle() runs instantly, turning the LED on or off.
