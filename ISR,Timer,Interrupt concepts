An ISR stands for Interrupt Service Routine.
In simple terms —
An ISR is a special function in your program that runs automatically when an interrupt occurs.
Detailed Explanation
When a specific event happens — like:
a button press,
a timer overflow,
or a sensor signal change,
the microcontroller pauses the main program and jumps immediately to execute the ISR function.
