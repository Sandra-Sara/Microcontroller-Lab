An ISR stands for Interrupt Service Routine.
In simple terms —
An ISR is a special function in your program that runs automatically when an interrupt occurs.
Detailed Explanation
When a specific event happens — like:
a button press,
a timer overflow,
or a sensor signal change,
the microcontroller pauses the main program and jumps immediately to execute the ISR function.

attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(2), toggle, FALLING);
void toggle() {
  digitalWrite(13, !digitalRead(13));
}
Here:
The event is the FALLING edge (button press: signal goes from HIGH → LOW).
The ISR is the function named toggle().
When the interrupt happens, toggle() runs instantly, turning the LED on or off.

Triggered automatically by hardware or software interrupt events.
Runs immediately, interrupting normal code execution.
Should be short and fast — never use long delays or Serial.print() inside.
After ISR finishes, the CPU returns to where it left off in the main program.
